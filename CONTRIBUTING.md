# Contributing

We love seeing new pull requests from others. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Fork, then clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/github-tell-me-when-it-closes-extension.git

Run the extension for a browser of your choice in _watch_ mode (i.e., for chrome), you can see a better example in the [README](README.md):

    yarn run chrome-watch

Make the changes you want to do, and ensure that they work. Unfortunately we don't have any tests around the code for this project yet, but that is a great opportunity to help on!

Build the extension for all three browsers:

    yarn run build

Do a quick sanity test for your change on the other browsers (i.e., Firefox and Opera).

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/kevinjalbert/github-tell-me-when-it-closes-extension/compare/).

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests as soon as possible (within a few days). We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
